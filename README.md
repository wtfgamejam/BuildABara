----------

To advance through the game, `left-click` or press the `space` or

arrow keys to select a choice and `enter` to activate it.

### Game Menu

When playing a game, `right-click` or press the `escape` key to enter
the game menu. The game menu gives the following choices:

Return
:   Returns to the game.
Save Game
:   Allows you to save a game by clicking on a save slot.
Load Game
:   Allows you to load a game by clicking on a save slot. Clicking on
    "Auto" accesses the automatic save slots.
Preferences
:   Changes the game preferences (options/configuration):
    Display
    :   Switches between fullscreen and windowed mode.
    Transitions
    :   Controls the display of transitions between game screens.
    Text Speed
    :   Controls the rate at which text displays. The further to the
        right this slider is, the faster the text will display. All the
        way to the right causes text to be shown instantly.
    Joystick
    :   Lets you control the game using a joystick.
    Skip
    :   Chooses between skipping messages that have been already seen
        (in any play through the game), and skipping all messages.
    Begin Skipping
    :   Returns to the game, while skipping.
    After Choices
    :   Controls if skipping stops upon reaching a menu.
    Auto-Forward Time
    :   Controls automatic advance. The further to the left this slider
        is, the shorter the amount of time before the game advances. All
        the way to the right means text will never auto-forward.
    Music, Sound, and Voice Volume
    :   Controls the volume of the Music, Sound effect, and Voice
        channels, respectively. The further to the right these are, the
        louder the volume.

Main Menu

Help
:   Shows this help screen.
Quit
:   Exits the game; the game will be closed and ended.
